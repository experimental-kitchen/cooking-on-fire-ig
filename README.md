# Cooking on Fire
## FHIR implementation guide (IG)
The 'Cooking on Fire' implementation guide describes the FHIR representation of a household's cooking recipes, including ingredients, steps and additional information. The members of a household can be cooks who cook according to these recipes, but also guests who enjoy the delicious menu. Cooking for people who do not live in the same household is also illustrated. It shows the guests' likes and dislikes of food and when they have visited.

## Local build of the implementation guide
As there is currently no CI build and no published version for this implementation guide, the IG must be built locally.   
Below is a short description of how this can be done.

* Clone this GitHub repository to a local folder:   
  `git clone https://github.com/experimental-kitchen/cooking-on-fire-ig.git`
* Get the latest IG publisher from https://github.com/HL7/fhir-ig-publisher/releases/latest/download/publisher.jar. 
   * Make sure you are always working with the lastest publisher 
   * Put the *publisher.jar* in the main directory of the cloned project
* A local build of the IG can be generated by running `JAVA -jar publisher.jar -ig ig.ini` at the command line
* See the output:
   * Implementation guide: `.\cooking-on-fire-ig\output\index.html`
   * Validation results (QA quality assurance): `.\cooking-on-fire-ig\output\qa.html`
