# Cooking on Fire
## FHIR implementation guide
The 'Cooking on Fire' implementation guide describes the FHIR representation of a household's cooking recipes, including ingredients, steps and additional information. The members of a household can be cooks who cook according to these recipes, but also guests who enjoy the delicious menu. Cooking for people who do not live in the same household is also illustrated. It shows the guests' likes and dislikes of food and when they have visited.
